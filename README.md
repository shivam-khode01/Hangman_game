# Hangman_game
A Python Hangman game challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends. It typically involves randomly selecting a word, displaying blanks for each letter, and updating them as correct letters are guessed, all while tracking incorrect guesses.
This is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. In this game, players must guess a word by entering one letter at a time. They have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

How to Play

1.Run the hangman.py file in your Python environment.
2.You will be presented with a word consisting of underscores representing hidden letters.
3.Enter a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you'll lose a life.
4.You have a total of 6 lives. If you run out of lives, the game is over.
5.If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of lives, you win!


Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the letter list to include your own words. Just add or remove words in the list, and the game will randomly select one for each playthrough.


Dependencies
This game relies on the random library for word selection and the hangman_images module for displaying the hangman stages.
Attribution
The visual representation of the hangman stages is provided by the hangman_images module.
